### You want to generate leads and opportunities, grow and scale, but you're not under pressure?

Then you get to play the long game. 

It's a good position to be in, because you can operate in a precise, thoughtful, methodical way. 

Meaning, you can work on opportunities that require more time to evolve, and probably more interactions with your buyer...

When such a deal closes, you're likely looking at a much higher payday than if you were in a rush, looking to close deals fast. 

There are many different ways to develop big-ticket sales and much depends on your industry and your market.

As a simple and humble web app, I can't tell you all the ins, outs, the pros & cons...

But, I've been designed to ask strategic questions, and one of the best questions to ask when you're playing the long game, is:
 
**Should I focus on the "Grow Up" ingredients of my business, or instead on the "Scale Up" ingredients?**

Meaning: 

At this stage, is your business best-served by consolidating what's working? (Grow Up)?

Or, are there systems and procedures in place, and we can handle increased sales and workload - are we ready to Scale Up?

There will be more in-depth training on this in the future, but for now, _Stages and ingredients of Business Growth_ (coming soon) should give you some foothold. 

<!--and "Three ways to grow a business" (Coming soon) should give you some ideas on where to focus.
