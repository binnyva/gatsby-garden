You can start something you hate by programming yourself to do something by counting down from 10. Its easy to start counting - more than actually doing the activity. But with enough programming, you'll be able to start things when you reach 0.

> What we have is not "free will" but a "free won't": that is, frontal reflection is mainly good for suppressing the default mode of action, more than originating new actions.
